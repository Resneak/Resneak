I'm Nate, I am a software developer who currently is in my last semester of univeristy. 

I love to write articles about intriguing software/AI and most of my repos have medium articles attached that you can read to learn more about the repo/project!

I also particularly love learning new things about machine learning & reverse engineering. ğŸ¤©
